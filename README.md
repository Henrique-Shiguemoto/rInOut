# rInOut

Simple library in C/C++ for file IO operations.

## Features

- Opening and Closing files
- Writing to file
- Reading from files
- File existence checking
- File size determination

## How to Use

Copy the <code>rInOut.c</code> and <code>rInOut.h</code> (or the C++ equivalent) files to your project. Then you can just include the <code>rInOut.h</code> in a source file.

Depending on your build system, you'll need to update it (like a Makefile for example), since this isn't a header-only library.
